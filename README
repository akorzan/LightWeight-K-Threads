All functionality for lwt_cgrp was implemented.  Certain features such as directed yeilds were
removed for part 3.

Garabage collection for threads flaged with LWT_NO_JOIN occurs
during lwt_die.

Kthd used to communicate between each other works but is not synchronized (bad).

Full Kthd functionality is broken.  I seem to be overwriting
some malloc specific memory as I segfault on malloc when I try to run test_multisend
from my kthread. Hence the following debug from Valgrind.
==20605== Process terminating with default action of signal 11 (SIGSEGV)
==20605==  Bad permissions for mapped region at address 0x41EEA54
==20605==    at 0x804B11A: test_multisend (lwt_chan.h:32)

To compile:
make

To run:
./main

To clean:
make clean
